  - And many more shadcn/ui components for a consistent UI design.

### Hooks

- **src/hooks/useTheme.tsx**: Custom hook for managing the application's theme (light/dark mode).
- **src/hooks/use-toast.ts**: Hook for displaying toast notifications.

### Utilities

- **src/lib/utils.ts**: Utility functions including the `cn` function for combining Tailwind classes.
- **src/fetch-timeout-polyfill.ts**: Polyfill for adding timeout functionality to fetch requests.

## Key Features

### 1. Process Monitoring

The application provides real-time monitoring of system processes with:

- A sortable and searchable table of processes
- Details including PID, name, status, CPU/memory usage, user, start time, threads, and priority
- Visual status indicators for running, sleeping, stopped, and zombie processes
- Pagination for navigating large process lists

### 2. Performance Visualization

Real-time charts display system performance metrics:

- CPU and memory usage over time with line charts
- Disk I/O and network activity with area charts
- Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes

### 3. AI Process Assistant

An intelligent assistant that can analyze process data:

- Natural language query interface
- Integration with local Ollama AI model (if available)
- Fallback to mock responses when Ollama is not running
- Persistent chat history during the session

### 4. Responsive Design

The application is fully responsive with:

- Adaptive layout for mobile, tablet, and desktop screens
- Glass-morphism UI elements that work in both light and dark mode
- Smooth animations and transitions

### 5. Theme Support

Complete light and dark theme support:

- User preference detection
- Theme persistence using local storage
- Theme toggle accessible throughout the application

## Technical Details

### Process Data Management

The application now uses a real backend server to provide system process data:

- Node.js server with Express framework
- systeminformation package for accurate system data
- Real-time process monitoring and resource usage tracking
- Automatic data refresh mechanism
- Fallback to mock data if server is unavailable

### Data Formatting

The server implements proper data formatting:

- Memory values converted to GB with 2 decimal places
- Disk usage calculated in GB
- Network speed calculated in MB/s
- CPU usage shown as percentage
- All values properly rounded and formatted

### Server Configuration

The server runs on port 3002 by default and can be configured through environment variables:

- `PORT`: Server port (default: 3002)
- CORS enabled for frontend communication
- TypeScript compilation settings for optimal performance

### Error Handling

The server implements comprehensive error handling:

- Try-catch blocks for all async operations
- Appropriate HTTP status codes for different scenarios
- Detailed error messages for debugging
- Graceful fallback mechanisms

### AI Integration

The application attempts to connect to a locally running Ollama instance:

- Checks for Ollama availability on port 11434
- Uses the "phi" model if available
- Falls back to mock responses if Ollama is not running
- Provides context-aware responses based on current process data

### Styling Approach

The project uses a custom styling approach with:

- Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
- Custom glass-morphism effect classes
- CSS variables for theme colors
- Responsive design breakpoints

### State Management

The application uses React's Context API for global state management:

- `ProcessProvider` for process data and chat history
- `ThemeProvider` for theme state
- Local component state for UI interactions

## Development Patterns

### Component Structure

Components follow a consistent pattern:

- Functional components with TypeScript typing
- Hook-based state management
- Separation of concerns between data, display, and interaction
- Consistent prop interfaces

### Performance Optimization

The application implements several performance optimizations:

- Memoization of filtered and sorted processes
- Controlled refresh intervals to avoid unnecessary re-renders
- Pagination to handle large datasets efficiently
- Efficient chart rendering with limited data points

## Deployment Considerations

When deploying ProcLens.ai:

1. The backend server needs to be running to provide real system process data.
2. Configure the frontend's API_BASE_URL to point to the correct server address.
3. Ensure proper CORS settings for production deployment.
4. Set up environment variables for server configuration.
5. Consider using a process manager like PM2 for production deployment.
6. The application is configured for deployment with Vite's build system.

## Future Enhancement Opportunities

Potential areas for future development:

1. **Process Management**: Add capability to end, pause, or restart processes.
2. **Historical Data**: Implement persistent storage for historical performance analysis.
3. **Advanced Filtering**: Add more sophisticated filtering and grouping options.
4. **User Accounts**: Add authentication to save preferences and queries.
5. **Backend Integration**: Replace mock data with real system process data.
6. **Enhanced AI Capabilities**: Extend AI capabilities with process optimization recommendations.
7. **System Alerts**: Add threshold-based alerts for resource usage.
8. **Remote Monitoring**: Add support for monitoring remote systems.

## Conclusion

ProcLens.ai demonstrates how modern web technologies can be used to create a sophisticated system monitoring interface with AI-powered assistance. The combination of real-time data visualization, responsive design, and natural language interaction provides users with an intuitive way to understand and manage system processes.
